        Why Choose Awfer ?
    </div>

    <div class="scroll-box">
    <div class="scroll-text">
        <p>Most mobility platforms today are built around control, not service. They decide who gets rides, how much you earn, when you work, and how prices change. Drivers face artificial limits, hidden algorithms, and fake demand surges designed to extract more value from both riders and workers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scroll-image">
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-text">

        <p>With Awfer, there is no artificial cap on income per hour.
        There are no hidden throttles, no manipulated surge pricing, and no algorithm designed to limit success. If demand is high, earnings are high. If a driver provides better service, they keep the full reward for it.</p>

        <p>Awfer operates on transparent, rule based pricing that reflects real supply and real demand. Riders pay what the trip is actually worth, and drivers receive what they actually earn. Nothing is distorted to benefit a central platform.</p>

        <p>We offer true freedom.</p>
        <p>Drivers choose when they work, how far they go, and which jobs they accept. Operators and fleets can define their own pricing models, coverage areas, and service categories. Cities can run transportation networks that fit their real needs, not the rules of a foreign corporation.</p>

        <p>Because Awfer does not sit between the people providing the service and the people using it, money flows directly where it belongs. More goes to drivers. More stays in local economies. More value reaches the people who actually create it.</p>

        <p>This is not an illusion of flexibility.</p>

        <p>This is the real deal.</p>
        <p>Awfer replaces control with trust, and extraction with fairness.</p>
